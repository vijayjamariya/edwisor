tast 1:
 we have to take the pokemon name as input and display the detail of that pokemon 
 	i have used one for loop for iteration from 0 to 150 and in that loop i have used one IF condition to match the user input pokemon name with a pokemon name which is in json data.
 	and displayed it on console

 task 2:
 Write a function that takes pokemon’s name as an argument and find out which all pokemon have that name in their “next_evolution” field

 in this problem   i have taken two for loop  1] one is for iteration from 0 to 150 and then i matched user input pokemon name with stored pokemon name and after getting matched   we used second for loop for displaying sub- next evolution pokemon names 

 task 3:
 Write a function that take a “Weakness” as an input and gives the names of all pokemon who have that Weakness. (check the weakness array in the dataset) 

 in this task logic is simple just took one loop for iteration and through second for loop i matched user input weakness with stored weaknesses and then i stored pokemon name into variable and displayed it
